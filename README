# Conference Room Booking System - Domain Model
This repository contains the core domain model for a Conference Room Booking System. The
focus of this project is to use C# as a domain-modeling language to enforce business rules and
maintain valid object states without relying on external libraries.

Project Structure
The solution is organized into logical units to ensure readiness for future Web API integration:
* **`ConferenceRoom.cs`**: Represents the physical booking resource.
* **`Booking.cs`**: Manages the lifecycle of a reservation.
* **`BookingRequest.cs`**: A DTO (Data Transfer Object) capturing user intent.
* **`Enums/`**: Contains `BookingStatus` and `RoomLayout` to restrict valid states.

Design Decisions & Justifications
### 1. Class vs. Record Usage
* **`ConferenceRoom` (Class):** Implemented as a class because a room has **Identity**. Even
if the name or capacity changes, it remains the same room.
* **`Booking` (Record):** Implemented as a record. Since a booking is essentially a snapshot of
a transaction in time, the value-based equality and immutability of records provide a safer way to
handle reservation data.
### 2. State Encapsulation
I avoided public fields and used **Property Initializers** (`init`) and **Private Setters**:
* Room `Id` and `Capacity` are set at creation and cannot be modified by external logic,
preventing accidental corruption of the domain.
* `BookingStatus` can only be changed via domain methods like `.Confirm()` or `.Cancel()`,
ensuring that status transitions are intentional.
### 3. Business Rule Enforcement (Validation)
Rules are enforced within the **Constructors**. This ensures that an object cannot exist in an
invalid state (**Always-Valid Domain Model**):
* **Capacity Check:** A room cannot be created with a capacity of 0 or less.
* **Chronological Integrity:** A booking cannot end before it starts.
* **String Validation:** Required fields like Room names cannot be null or whitespace.
### 4. Domain Vocabulary (Enums)
Instead of using strings for layouts or statuses, I used Enums (`RoomLayout`). This prevents
"magic strings" and ensures that the system only supports specific, predefined business
configurations.

Demonstration
The `Program.cs` file serves as a demonstration harness. It executes the following flow:
1. Instantiates a valid `ConferenceRoom`.
2. Captures a `BookingRequest` (simulating user input).
3. Attempts to create a `Booking`, triggering validation logic.
4. Demonstrates a state transition from `Pending` to `Confirmed`.
5. Triggers and catches an `ArgumentException` to prove that invalid time ranges are rejected
by the domain logic.
